Hello Keri,

The feedback is collected below. Unless otherwise noted, we agree with
your //..// comments.

We also want some more extensive simplifications done in the Fwrap
section, and there's an updated bio for Dag Sverre Seljebotn. You may
make stylistic changes to this new content as you see fit without
consulting us further.

 * The "Beyond Pure Python" section seems misplaced. We suggest to
   rename it to "Related work" and move it to just before the Fwrap
   section.

   However, we still want to give credit to Pyrex and Greg Ewing near
   the top. So insert a sentence in the introduction referencing the
   section (before "Finally, we describe Fwrap"): 

       Cython is based on Greg Ewing’s Pyrex, and we describe the
       differences and compare Pyrex and other related tools.

 * Data transformation and reduction: The new text is incorrect.
   Suggestion: "[...] for three vectors x, y, and z. For such
   expressions, you usually don’t need to use Cython, as the NumPy
   operations tend to be fast enough.

 * Optimization and problem solving: It should definitely say
   "equation in 12 variables", not "with".

 * Optimization and problem solving, last sentence: New text is
   incorrect. Suggestion: "[...] using Newton's method on equations in
   a single variable, for example."

 * Fwrap section: We found something that is factually incorrect.
   Please replace: "Fwrap’s approach differs in that it leverages
   Cython’s power for the Python bindings, and the C interoperability
   allows Fwrap to support Fortran features--such as derived
   types--that these other tools don’t."

   With this: "Fwrap's approach differs in that it leverages Cython to
   create Python bindings.  Manual tuning of the wrapper can be easily
   accomplished by simply modifying the generated Cython code, rather
   than using a restricted domain-specific language.  Another benefit
   is reduced overhead when calling Fortran code from Python."

 * Fwrap section: We want to simplify; please replace 4 paragraphs
   starting with "Invoking fwrapc" with (again, feel free to make
   stylistic changes):

   "When invoked on the above Fortran code, Fwrap parses the code and
   makes it available to C, Cython and Python.  If desired, we can
   generate a deployable package for use on computers that don't have
   Fwrap or Cython installed.  To use the wrapped code from Python,//
   we must first set up the subroutine arguments—in particular, the a
   array argument. To do this, we set the array dimensions and then
   create the array, filling it with random values. To simplify
   matters, we set all array dimensions equal to m:"

 * Limitations section: We do not want to add "in" where you suggest.

 * References: Please drop reference 2 (Smith & Seljebotn) from the list.

 * References: Reference 5, J. Bergstra, should be "J. Bergstra et al."
   (there are 8 authors in total). Also, it is merely submitted and
   not published yet; preprint URL:

 * Author bios: Dag Sverre has recently been awarded a PhD
   scholarship and would appriciate if the bio could be replaced:

   Dag Sverre Seljebotn is a doctoral student in the Institute of
   Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, Norway, where
   he studies computational cosmology, in particular cosmic microwave
   background analysis. Seljebotn has a MSc in computational science
   from the same university. Contact him at dagseljebotn@gmail.com.

 * Author bios: Kurt is with the Department of Physics. CFD is spelled
   out Computational Fluid Dynamics.
 
 * Author bios: Lisandro's email is dalcinl@gmail.com.
